NAME
----
mqrestt - daemon to translate MQTT messages to REST POST calls
          and vica versa


SYNOPSIS
--------
*mqrestt* ['OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------

 MQRESTT is a daemon/service which can either subscribe to certain topics 
 on the configured MQTT broker and translate received MQTT messages into 
 REST POST calls or acting as a simple HTTP(s) server, and publishing the 
 incoming POST requests via MQTT.
 In the MQTT->REST case the URI of the POST call is fabricated from the 
 MQTT topic the message was received on, and the body is the MQTT message
 itself.
 In the REST->MQTT case similarly, the MQTT topic is fabricated based on 
 the URI of the incoming request.
 The 2 use-case can run simultaneously, and can have multiple units
 configured, therefore it's possible to subscribe to 2 different topics
 and forward the messages to different web applications living on different 
 hosts.
